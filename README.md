# Jobbler Dataset Project
 This is a GUI based program in python made for searching the best paying job for you with the help of a dataset.
- Made by Luis Wettre (Github:Tomatosoop1)
-Dataset obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rkiattisak/salaly-prediction-for-beginer

Note: Because the dataset is not too big alot of countries, ages etc are not includes and the program doesnt give a fully accurate result. Don't take this as a direct 100% True answer to the best paying jobs it's just a project i made for fun.

Note: about 90% off the data comes from the United-States so i would recommend to input that! 
Also when inputing Gender do Male or Female


Thanks for downloading!
